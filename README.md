This app takes in a use input through the terminal and searches from various API's to find results based upon said user input.  In the terminal the user can type "Node liri" to start, and can then add "movie", "concert", or "spotify" after "liri" to declair what they wish to search for. After the declairing what they want to search for they can type in text to search for a specific thing. This can all be seen in the included [demove video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=116JUhaCF8DRyIHq6-dzgD9S-92XK9IAG) above.
